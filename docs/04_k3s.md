# K3S installation and setup
1. Change dir to [03_k3s folder](../ansible/04_k3s) and make sure all ENV variables are loaded.
2. Run the Ansible playbook.
   ```shell
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml playbook.yaml
   ```
3. Copy kubeconfig file to your local machine.
   ```shell
   scp server:/home/user/.kube/config ~/.kube/config_server
   ```
4. Modify it to your needs. You can e.g. merge it with your local kubeconfig file.
   ```shell
   KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config_server:~/.kube/config kubectl config view --flatten > ~/.kube/config
   ```

🎉 You can continue to [services setup](05_services.md).
